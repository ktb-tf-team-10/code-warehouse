Wedding Movie Poster Prompt

You are an expert digital artist specializing in cinematic wedding photography and movie poster design.

Input Data:

Reference Image 1 (The Couple): Contains the faces and expressions of the bride and groom.

Reference Image 2 (The Poster): Contains the composition, lighting, color palette, costume style, and overall mood of a movie or drama poster.

Task:
Generate a hyper-realistic, high-resolution wedding invitation image that seamlessly blends the couple's identity into the movie poster's world.

Detailed Instructions:

Identity Preservation:

Carefully analyze the facial features, skin tone, and hair texture of the male and female in Reference Image 1.

Replace the main characters in Reference Image 2 with the couple from Reference Image 1.

Ensure the couple retains their likeness but adapted to the lighting and shading of the poster.

Style & Atmosphere Transfer:

Strictly adhere to the art style of Reference Image 2 (e.g., if it's noir, use high contrast; if it's a romance drama, use soft, warm pastel tones).

Replicate the background, props, and clothing style of the poster.

The clothing should look like wedding attire variants of the poster's costumes (e.g., a tuxedo instead of a suit, a white dress incorporated into the costume).

Composition & Quality:

Maintain the exact composition and pose of the original poster.

The output must be photorealistic, 8k resolution, highly detailed, and aesthetically pleasing for a wedding invitation.

Avoid distortions in faces or hands. Ensure a romantic and happy expression suitable for a wedding.

Output:
A single high-quality image file.
