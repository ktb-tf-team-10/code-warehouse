**Full-body studio photograph of a hybrid couple figure isolated on a solid white background.** This image must be a strict composite created by following these specific source rules:

1.  **STRICT SOURCE FOR ANATOMY & FEATURES (FROM [Image 1]):** The figures must possess the exact **facial features, head structures, and precise body physiques** (including specific height differences, muscle definition, shoulder width, and overall proportions) of the man and woman in [Image 1]. You must COMPLETELY IGNORE the clothing and pose seen in [Image 1].

2.  **STRICT SOURCE FOR ATTIRE & POSE (FROM [Image 2]):** The figures must be wearing the exact **clothing and accessories, and holding the precise pose** shown in [Image 2]. You must COMPLETELY IGNORE the facial features and body structures seen in [Image 2].

3.  **RENDERING STYLE (FROM [Image 3]):** The entire scene, including skin and fabric surfaces, must be rendered with the **material texture and style** defined by [Image 3] (e.g., if [Image 3] is LEGO, make them LEGO brick figures; if plastic, make them smooth plastic toys).

**Final Requirement:** The view must be strictly full-body from head to toe, fully recreating any parts cropped in the references with volumetric studio lighting.
