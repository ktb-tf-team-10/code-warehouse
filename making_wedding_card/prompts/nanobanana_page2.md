**[Input Requirements]**
- Context Reference: The generated image from Page 1
- Style Reference: Provided style reference image

**[Execution Prompt]**
Create the second page as a flat, print-ready digital design, strictly maintaining the Page 1 identity.
1.  **Background Continuity:** Replicate the exact background texture and {border_design_id} from the Page 1 result. The canvas must look identical to Page 1.
2.  **Unified Ink Color (Crucial):** Use the **exact text color** found in Page 1. Apply this color to **BOTH** the titles and the body paragraph. **ABSOLUTELY NO DEFAULT BLACK TEXT.** All text must be in the specific theme color.
3.  **Font Consistency:** Use the same font style (Serif/Myeongjo or Script) as Page 1. Do not switch to generic Gothic/Sans-serif for the long text.
4.  **Content:** Center-align the following text:
    * Greeting: {texts[greeting]}
    * Invitation: {texts[invitation]}
5.  **Layout:** Keep it clean, centered, and flat.
